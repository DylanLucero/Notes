# r - Combinations
Definition: An _**r - combination**_ is a combination of r objects from a set of n elements where repetition is allowed.

  
## Formula 
The number of ways to choose r objects from a set of n elements where repetition is allowed is
$$\begin{pmatrix}r+n-1 \\ r\end{pmatrix}$$
a) You are buying 20 sodas for a party and have 5 different types to choose from. How many ways can you choose the sodas if you can have as many of each type as you would like?

Solution:  $r = 20$ and $n = 5$  
  $$\begin{pmatrix}20+5-1\\20\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}24\\20\end{pmatrix}=10,626$$ 
b) How many solutions are there to the equation

$$x_1+x_2+x_3=10$$
where $x_1,x_2,x_3$  are non-negative integers?

Solution:   $r = 10$ and $n = 3$
$$\begin{pmatrix}10+3-1\\10\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}12\\10\end{pmatrix}=66$$
