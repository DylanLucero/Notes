In this chapter, we will learn how to count the number of elements in more complicated sets.

Recall from Chapter 5 the definition of [[Section 5.3 - Equivalence Classes#^82b94b|partition]].

#### Theorem:
The addition rule states that if a set A can be written as a finite partition of subsets such that $A = P_1 \cup P_2 \;\cup\; ... \; \;\cup\; P_n$ with $P_n \;\cap\;P_j = \not 0$ for all $i,\;j$ then $|A|= |P_1|+|P_2|\;+\;...\; |P_n|$.

# Example
$$C(n,k)=\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
