In this section, we will use probabilities and the idea of long term frequencies  to learn about expected values. The _**expected value**_ of an experiment is the long run weighted average of a repeated experiment. We have seen that the long term relative frequency approximates the theoretical probability of a repeated experiment. In the same way, we can use theoretical probabilities to approximate the long term average of an experiment.

Process for finding an expected value: Multiply the probability of each outcome by the outcome value, and then add the results.

# Expected Value

1) 
a) A six sided die is rolled repeatedly with possible outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 where each outcome is equally likely with probability 1616  . What is the expected value of the number rolled?

  
**Solution**: Since each outcome has a probability of 1616  , multiply each value by 1616  and add the results.

16×1+16×2+16×3+16×4+16×5+16×616×1+16×2+16×3+16×4+16×5+16×6 

=16+26+36+46+56+66=1+2+3+4+5+66=216=3.5=16+26+36+46+56+66=1+2+3+4+5+66=216=3.5 

**Answer**: The expected number of a six sided die rolled repeatedly is 3.5. (Note the die can never land on 3.5. This is similar to means or averages that are not included in a data set.)

b) You and a friend are playing a game. You randomly draw one card from a 52 card deck. If the card is a face card, your friend gives you $3. If the card is anything else, you give your friend $1. What is your expected value for this game to the nearest cent?

**Solution**: There are a total of 12 face cards so the probability of drawing a face card is 1252=3131252=313 , and the probability of not drawing a face card is 4052=10134052=1013 . Multiply these by the gains or losses.

313×$3+1013×−$1=913−1013=$113≈−$0.08313×$3+1013×-$1=913-1013=$113≈-$0.08 

**Answer**: Your expected value for this game is -$0.08 , meaning, if you play these game repeatedly, on average, you will lose approximately 8 cents per game



2) 
a) A company offers a 5 year warranty on a product for $30. Replacing the product to the consumer who purchases the warranty costs the company $125. The quality control division estimates that 1.37% of their products will fail within the first 5 years. What is the company’s expected value for each warranty sold?

b) A school is holding a raffle for a $500 prize. They sold 300 tickets at a cost of $2 per ticket. What is your expected value if you bought a single ticket? What is the school’s expected value per ticket? A fair game is when the players each have an expected value of 0. Is this game fair?
