In this section, we will look at an example of an empirical probability using relative frequency. Recall that frequency is the number of times an event occurs, and relative frequency is the frequency divided by a total amount such as the number of times an experiment is run or the number of people in an experiment.

  
We will also use a random process. Some examples of random processes are flipping a coin, rolling a die, or picking a name out of a hat (returning the original name before each new pick). The main components of a random process are that each time you perform the process or experiment the possible outcomes and chances are identical to the other experiments, and the previous outcome does not affect the next outcome (this is why we would put the name back in the hat before picking a new name).

  
Notice that the word random does not have the same meaning in probability as it does in everyday language. Some synonyms given by Microsoft Word for the word random are, “accidental, haphazard, arbitrary, unsystematic, and unplanned.” In probability, these words are very misleading. We are very systematic and planned when we perform a random process. Our goal in planning is to ensure that we are not affecting the outcome and that each outcome is not dependent on a previous outcome. As you will see, the short term relative frequency of the outcomes of a random process are unpredictable, but the long term relative frequencies tend to be stable and close to a specific percentage. The next example will help us develop these ideas.

  
**Part 1**: A fair coin is tossed repeatedly. The graph represents the relative frequency of heads that occur (number of heads divided by the total number of tosses) versus the number of times the coin was tossed for the first 10 tosses. The table shows these categories, and in addition, the total number of heads after each number of tosses. Use this information to answer the questions below.

a) What is the minimum relative frequency of the number of heads for the first 10 tosses?

  
b) What is the maximum relative frequency of the number of heads for the first 10 tosses?

  
c) What is the difference between the minimum relative frequency and the maximum relative frequency of the number of heads for the first 10 tosses? Write your answer as a percent.

  
**Part 2**: The graph below represents the relative frequency of heads that occur (number of heads divided by the total number of tosses) versus the number of times the coin was tossed for the first 1000 tosses. The table shows these categories, and in addition, the total number of heads for the 9,991st to 10,000th tosses. Use this information to answer the questions below.

|**Long Term Relative Frequency**|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Number of Tosses|9991|9992|9993|9994|9995|9996|9997|9998|9999|10000|

a) What is the minimum relative frequency of the number of heads for the tosses between 9,991 and 10,000?

b) What is the maximum relative frequency of the number of heads for the tosses between 9,991 and 10,000?

c) What is the difference between the minimum relative frequency and the maximum relative frequency of the number of heads for the tosses between 9,991 and 10,000? Write your answer as a percent.

  
d) Since the coin is fair, on average, approximately half of the tosses should be heads. So when the coin is tossed 10,000 times approximately 5000 of the tosses should be heads. What is the actual number of heads for 10,000 tosses as given by the chart?

e) What is the difference between the number of heads we should expect on average, 5000, and the actual number of heads for 10,000 tosses?

f) What is the difference between the percent we expect to be heads on average, 50%, and the relative frequency as a percent for 10,000 tosses?

# Summary and Analysis of Random Processes and Relative Frequency

**Short Term Relative Frequency**: The image below shows the short-term relative frequency for ten coin tosses for the Media Example and You Try Problem. These were both randomly generated. Observe the differences between the two graphs. The Media Example began with 3 tosses of tails and a relative frequency of 0. The relative frequency then increases to 0.5 after 6 tosses and varied as the coin flips increased. In contrast, the You Try problem began with 2 tosses of heads and a relative frequency of 1. The relative frequency then decreases to 0.67 after 3 tosses and varied as the coin flips increased. This illustrates an important fact: The short-term frequency of random processes is unpredictable.

**Long-term Relative Frequency**: Now let’s consider the long-term relative frequency. The image below shows the long-term relative frequency for 1000 coin tosses for the Media Example and You Try Problem. These were both randomly generated. Observe the differences between the two graphs. The graphs appear to have different behavior or patterns for the first 100 or 200 tosses. However, after many tosses, both graphs appear to stabilize and center around or near the value 0.5. This illustrates an important fact: The long-term frequency of random processes is stable.

A consequence of these facts is that in the short run, you are not likely to get predictable results or determine the underlying behavior of the random process, but in the long run, you can observe stabilized results. In addition, the long-term relative frequency approximates the theoretical probability of the random process. This fact is called the Law of Large Numbers.  
One real world application of this fact is how casinos earn money. A few people playing can win large jackpots that cost the casino a lot of money, but in the long run enough people will lose to counteract this effect. Similarly, an insurance company may have to pay some large death premiums, but a large amount of people will live and continue to make payments. We will revisit these ideas in a later Objective when we discuss expected value.
