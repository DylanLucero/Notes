# Types of Probability
There are three types of probability people use. The first is a _**personal probability or a subjective probability**_. A personal probability is when someone assigns a quantity based on their experience, but without any data collection to back up their results. These probabilities are based on experience, but are not scientifically determined.

For example, you may have a friend who you know very well and you can frequently predict their behavior. Perhaps they are habitually late, have always remembered your birthday, or go to sleep before 10 p.m. You may assign numbers to these events such as:

  
• There is a 75% chance my friend will be late picking me up.  
• There is a 3% chance my friend will forget my birthday.  
• Since it is 11 p.m., there is a 99% chance that my friend is already asleep.

  
These values give us a feel for the likelihood of an event and are useful in everyday life, but they are not determined by a scientific process and there isn’t a way to measure their accuracy.

A second type of probability is a _**theoretical probability**_. These probabilities use mathematics and not observations or experiments to determine the likelihood of an event. For example, if you flip a fair coin, the probability it lands on heads is ½. This probability is found by determining that there are two outcomes, heads or tails, and since we are given that the coin is “fair” each outcome is equally likely to occur. Therefore, the probability of heads is 1 out of 2 or ½. We will compute many of these probabilities in the next few units.

The third type of probability is an _**empirical or experimental probability**_. This type of probability is used frequently in science to test hypotheses. For example, if a pharmaceutical company wants to determine if a newly developed drug cures a disease, they will design an experiment to determine the percentage of people in the experiment (subjects) that are cured by their treatment. The actual experiment is much more complex than this to ensure scientific validity, and many variables need to be accounted for that are not mentioned here. However, observe that this is different than a personal probability because it is intentionally performing an experiment and recording the results to quantify a probability as opposed to recollecting past experiences to make a judgement. In the next Objective, we will look at some very basic experiments to see the power of empirical probabilities and how their results can provide us insight into likelihood.
