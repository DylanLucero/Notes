Recall from Section 9.2  that a _**theoretical probability**_ uses mathematics and not observations or experiments to determine the likelihood of an event. In the last section, we found  that in one experiment, if we flipped a coin 10,000 times the long term relative frequency of the number of times the coin landed on heads was 0.4962. However, _**theoretically**_, if you flip a fair coin, the probability it lands on heads is ½. This probability is found by determining that there are two outcomes, heads or tails, and since we are given that the coin is “fair” each outcome is equally likely to occur. Therefore, the probability of heads is 1 out of 2 or ½.

This will be our strategy for finding theoretical probabilities. We will determine all the possible outcomes of an experiment. We will create a list or set of these outcomes so that each outcome is equally likely. The number of elements in this set, S, will be our total and the denominator of the ratio. Then we will look specifically at the event in which we are interested. This event such as landing on heads or picking a red card will be a subset of all the possible outcomes. The number of elements in this set, E, will be our part and the numerator of the ratio. The information below summarizes these ideas.

1) Let S be a set called the _**sample space**_ that contains all of the possible outcomes of an experiment written so that all of the outcomes in S are equally likely to occur.

2) Let E be a set called the _**event space**_. E is a subset of S that contains all of the equally likely outcomes of S in which we want to find a probability.

3) The theoretical probability of the event E with sample space S is

Probability of the event E = number of elements in Enumber of elements in S=number of equally likely ways E can occurnumber of equally likely ways S can occurnumber of elements in Enumber of elements in S=number of equally likely ways E can occurnumber of equally likely ways S can occur

# Event Space, Sample Space, and Theoretical Probability
1) A fair single six sided die is rolled. The sides are labeled with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 dots.

  
a) What is the sample space for the experiment of rolling a single sided die and observing the number of dots on the top side?

**Solution**: We are given that the die is “fair” meaning that each side of the die is equally likely to land up in an experiment. (This is often implied instead of stated in the problem.) So the possible equally likely outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.  
**Answer**: The sample space, S = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }

  
b) What is the event space for the following event: the die lands on 3.

**Solution**: The event space is a subset of the sample space and lists the possible outcomes from S that apply to the specific event. So the event space in this case, contains only the number 3.  
**Answer:** The event space E = { 3 }

  
c) What is the probability the die lands on 3?

**Solution**: The formula for the theoretical probability is the number of elements in E, 1, divided by the number of elements is S, 6.  
**Answer**: The probability the die lands on 3 is 1616 

  
2) Sylvia has 12 marbles as shown in the diagram below. Each marble is either blue (labeled with a B), red (labeled with an R), or yellow (labeled with a Y).

  
a) What is the sample space for the experiment of choosing a marble at random and observing its color?

**Solution**: Since we are told we are choosing a marble at random it is implied that each of the 12 marbles are equally likely to be chosen. It may be tempting to list the sample space outcomes as red, blue, and yellow. However, note that there are more red marbles than blue or yellow marbles and more yellow marbles than blue marbles. So these three outcomes are not equally likely.

To remedy this disparity, we will think of each of the 12 marbles as distinguishable. By this we mean we will label each of the marbles with a number as well as a color so we can differentiate them from one another. There are 7 red marbles, 4 yellow marbles, and one blue marble.

**Answer**: The sample space, S = {R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, B1}

  
b) What is the event space for the following event: the marble chosen is yellow.

**Solution**: The event space is a subset of the sample space and lists the possible outcomes from S that apply to the specific event. So the event space in this case, contains the four yellow marbles.

**Answer**: The event space E = {Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4}

  
c) What is the probability the marble chosen in yellow?

**Solution**: The formula for the theoretical probability is the number of elements in E, 4, divided by the number of elements is S, 12.

**Answer**: The probability the marble is yellow is 412=13412=13 

(Note it is customary to simplify the fraction when possible).

# Probabilities Involving Unions and Intersections
Recall from our study of sets and Venn Diagrams that the intersection of two sets, A∩B�∩�  refers to any elements in both A and in B. The union of two sets, A∪B�∪�  refers to any elements that are only in A, only in B, or in both A and B (the intersection of A and B). Since theoretical probabilities involve determining the number of elements in a set, we will can use the ideas learned about sets to count the number of elements for event spaces.

**Group C**

Let E1�1  and E2�2  be two events for an experiment. Determine a formula for the probability of E1∪E2�1∪�2  based on the problems in Groups A and B.

Group C Results:

The probability of E1∪E2�1∪�2  = probability of E1�1  + probability of E2�2  – probability of E1∩E2�1∩�2   
Two events E1�1  and E2�2  are called mutually exclusive, if their intersection is empty, E1∩E2=�1∩�2=  ![image](https://moer.maricopa.edu/filestore/ufiles/2745/mceclip5-1602648236551.png)  
If two events are mutually exclusive, the probability of E1∪E2�1∪�2  is the prob of E1�1  + prob of E2�2 .

# Probabilities and Complements
Recall from sets and Venn diagrams, that the _**complement of a set A**_ is denoted by A’, and means not A. This set contains any elements in U that are not in the set A. In terms of probability, our universal set is denoted by the sample space of equally likely outcomes S, and we refer to the subset as E, the corresponding event space for the probability.
