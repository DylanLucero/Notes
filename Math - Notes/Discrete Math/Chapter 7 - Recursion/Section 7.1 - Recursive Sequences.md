# Recursive Sequence

A **recursive sequence** is a sequence where the formula defines the terms with respect to previous terms. At least the first term is given and is called an initial condition.

## Example

### Finding Terms of a Recursive Sequence

Find the first 5 terms of the following sequences and then write the sequence in list form.

Let $a_{k} = a_{k-1} + 3$ for $k \geq 2$ initial condition: $a_{1}= 4$

$a_1 = 4$ (initial condition)
$a_{2}= a_{2-1}+3=a_{1}+3=4+3=7$
$a_{3}=a_{3-1}+3=a_{2} +3=7+3=10$
$a_{4}=a_{4-1}+3=a_{3} +3=10+3=13$
$a_{5}=a_{5-1}+3=a_{4} +3=13+3=16$

List form: $4, 7, 10, 13, 16, ...$

---
Let $c_{n}= 2(c_{n-1})$ for $n \geq 1$. Initial condition: $c_0=3$

$c_0=3$ (initial condition)
$c_{1}= 2(c_{1-1})=2(3)=6$
$c_{2}=2(c_{2-1})=2(6)=12$
$c_{3}=2(c_{3-1})=2(12)=24$
$c_{4}=2(c_{4-1})=2(24)=48$

List form: $3,6,12,24,48,...$

# The Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci Sequence has the form:$$F_{k}= F_{k-1}+ F_{k-2}$$
The initial conditions are:$$F_0=F_1=1$$
The terms of the Fibonacci Sequence are called **Fibonacci Numbers**. They have many applications in nature, art, and science.
