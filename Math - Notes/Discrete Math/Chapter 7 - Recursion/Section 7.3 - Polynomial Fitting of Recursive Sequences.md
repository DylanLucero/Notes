Recall from Chapter 6 that to fit polynomials to sequences by finding differences. 

Here is the process we used when given the first few terms of a sequence.

Method:  

1) Find the sequences of the difference of terms until you reach a constant sequence.  

2) If you do not reach a constant sequence, it is not a polynomial.  

3) If you do reach a constant sequence, the degree of the polynomial is $k$, where $k$ is the number of difference sequences it takes to reach a constant sequence.  

4) Set up a system of $k+1$ equations with $k+1$ variables using the terms of the original sequence and the form of a $k^{th}$ degree polynomial.  

5) Solve the system for the coefficients of the polynomial.

If we have a recursive form of a sequence that may be a polynomial, we may be able to recognize its degree by inspecting the formula.

Then we will verify if our formula is correct using induction.
