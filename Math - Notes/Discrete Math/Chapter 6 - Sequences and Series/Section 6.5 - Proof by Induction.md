Proof by induction is another method of proof that is especially useful with series in this chapter. Here is the structure of proof by induction.
  
You have a statement of the form: For $∀n∈Z$  with $n≥a$ , some property is true.

Step 1: This is called the base case. Show that the property is true for $n = a$ (usually a is 0 or 1).

Step 2: Assume the property is true for some arbitrary value $k$ where $k≥a$ .  this is called the induction hypothesis.
  
Step 3: This is called the inductive step. Show that if the property is true for $k$, it must also be true for $k + 1$.
