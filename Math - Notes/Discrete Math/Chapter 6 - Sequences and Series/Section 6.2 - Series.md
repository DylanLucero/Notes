# Definition
A series is the sum of terms of a sequence. ^133d67

# Notation
We use sigma notation to indicate that we are adding the terms of a sequence. Let $a_k$ be a sequence and let $S_n$ = $a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n$ be the sum of the first n terms of the sequence. we denote this sum as:
$$\sum_{k=1}^n a_k = 8_n$$
We call $k$ the **index** of the sum, 1 is the **lower limit** and $n$ is the **upper limit**.
# Examples
### a) 
Let: $$a_k = \frac{k}{k + 1}$$Find: $$\sum_{k=1}^5 a_k$$
Looking at the summation we are given, notice we are iterating 5 times. Referring back to our [[#^133d67|definition]] of a series, we need to evaluate each term and add them together. What this will look like is: $$\sum_{k=1}^5 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{3}{4} + \frac{5}{6}$$
Using a calculator to sum everything up we get an answer of: $$\frac{71}{20}$$
So, $$\sum_{k=1}^5 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{3}{4} + \frac{5}{6} = \frac{71}{20}$$
### b) 
Let:$$c_n = (-1)^{n-1}(\frac{1}{n})$$Find: $$\sum_{n=1}^4 c_n$$
Looking at the summation, we can see 4 iterations of $c_n$. Writing it all out we get: $$\sum_{n=1}^4 = 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4}$$
Again, using a calculator, we come up with the answer of: $$\frac{7}{12}$$
So, our final statement is: $$\sum_{n=1}^4 = 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{12}$$
