# Definitions 
###### Predicate:
A **predicate** is a sentence whose truth values depend on one or more variable. The variables have a domain of permissible values.

##### Truth Set:
The **truth set** of a predicate is all of the elements in the domain that make the predicate true.

# Example - Predicates
1. let $\mathbb{R}$ = the set of real numbers where x is an arbitrary element of $\mathbb{R}$. Let $P(x)$ be the predicate "$x^2 > 2x$". State the domain and find the truth values for $P(4),\;P(0)$ and $P(-1)$.

	Solution:
	The domain is the set of real numbers or $\mathbb{R}$:

	$P(4):\;4^2\;>\;2(4)$ or $16 > 8$ so $P(4)$ is *True*.
	$P(0):\;0^2\;>\;2(0)$ or $0 \gt 0$ so $P(0)$ is *False*.
	$P(-1):\;-1^2\;>\;2(-1)$ or $-1 > -2$ so $P(-1)$ is *True*.

2. Let $\mathbb{N}=$ the set of natural numbers where n is an arbitrary element of. Let $P(n)$ be the predicate “n is even”. State the domain and find the truth values for $P(2)$ and $P(5)$. 

	Solution: 
	The domain is the set of natural numbers or $\mathbb{N}$

	$P(2)$: $2$ is an even number so $P(2$) is True
	$P(5)$: $5$ is an odd number so $P(5)$ is False

We can write the truth set using set builder notation.
# Example - Truth Sets
1) Let = the set of real numbers where x is an arbitrary element of . Let P(x) be the predicate “x² > 2x”. 
	
	Truth Set: {$x \in \mathbb{R}\;|\;x^2>2x$} 
	
	Read as, “The set of all x that belong to the real numbers such that x² > 2x” 

1) Let = the set of natural numbers where n is an arbitrary element of . Let P(n) be the predicate “n is even”. 
	
	Truth Set: {$n \in \mathbb{N}\;|\;n\;is\;even$}
	
	Read as, “The set of all n that belong to the natural numbers such that n is even” Chapter 2 – Logic Part 2 3
