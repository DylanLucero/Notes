This is a list of some common equivalences that come up frequently in logic that can help us simplify a statement form and make it more manageable. The list below contains these common forms and their names.

In the list below, p, q, and r are statements. "t" is any statement that is a [[Section 1.2 - Logical Equivalence#^463978|tautology]]. "c" is any statement that is a [[Section 1.2 - Logical Equivalence#^6e5003|contradiction]]. The symbol "≡" means "[[Section 1.2 - Logical Equivalence#^44aa4e|logically equivalent to]]".

1) Commutative: p ˄ q ≡ q ˄ p p ˅ q ≡ q ˅ p 
2) Associative: p ˄ (q ˄ r) ≡ (p ˄ q) ˄ r p ˅ (q ˅ r) ≡ (p ˅ q) ˅ r 
3) Distributive: p ˄ (q ˅ r) ≡ (p ˄ q) ˅ (p ˄ r) p ˅ (q ˄ r) ≡ (p ˅ q) ˄ (p ˅ r) 
4) Identity: p ˄ t ≡ p p ˅ c ≡ p 
5) Negation: p ˅ ~p ≡ t p ˄ ~p ≡ c 
6) Idempotent: p ˄ p ≡ p p ˅ p ≡ p 
7) Universal Bound: p ˅ t ≡ t p ˄ c ≡ c 
8) DeMorgan’s: ~(p ˄ q) ≡ ~p ˅ ~q ~(p ˅ q) ≡ ~p ˄ ~q 
9) Absorption: p ˅ ( p ˄ q) ≡ p p ˄ (p ˅ q) ≡ p
10) Double Negation: ~ (~p) ≡ p
